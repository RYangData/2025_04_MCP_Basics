    "summary": "Artificial intelligence based chatbots have brought unprecedented business\npotential. This study aims to explore consumers trust and response to a\ntext-based chatbot in ecommerce, involving the moderating effects of task\ncomplexity and chatbot identity disclosure. A survey method with 299 useable\nresponses was conducted in this research. This study adopted the ordinary least\nsquares regression to test the hypotheses. First, the consumers perception of\nboth the empathy and friendliness of the chatbot positively impacts their trust\nin it. Second, task complexity negatively moderates the relationship between\nfriendliness and consumers trust. Third, disclosure of the text based chatbot\nnegatively moderates the relationship between empathy and consumers trust,\nwhile it positively moderates the relationship between friendliness and\nconsumers trust. Fourth, consumers trust in the chatbot increases their\nreliance on the chatbot and decreases their resistance to the chatbot in future\ninteractions. Adopting the stimulus organism response framework, this study\nprovides important insights on consumers perception and response to the\ntext-based chatbot. The findings of this research also make suggestions that\ncan increase consumers positive responses to text based chatbots. Extant\nstudies have investigated the effects of automated bots attributes on consumers\nperceptions. However, the boundary conditions of these effects are largely\nignored. This research is one of the first attempts to provide a deep\nunderstanding of consumers responses to a chatbot.",
