# Weather App Playground

This directory contains the initial weather application code:

- `server/weather.py`: Main weather application with NWS API integration
- `server/client.py`: Client application for interacting with the weather API
- `server/weather.json`: Configuration file for the MCP server
- `main.py`: Simple entry point script

## Running the Weather App

To run the weather client:

```bash
cd 0_Init_Playground
python server/client.py
```

This will start an interactive session where you can query for weather alerts by state code.
